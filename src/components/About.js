          My name is Jack Humphrey and I am a software developer based in
          Wellington, New Zealand. I have a particular interest in front end web
          development, with a focus on usability and simplicity of design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of development, my interests include art and design, including
          painting and illustration. I am a keen pianist and hold a DipABRSM in
          piano performance. I also enjoy writing and producing my own music. I
          also have an bachelors degree in Mathematics, which has informed some
          of my endeavors in development.

          I hold a Masters degree in Software Development from the Wellington
          ICT Graduate School. I have a broad foundation in development, as well
          as strong communication skills. Since then, I have been working on
          various projects including client work to widen my skills as a
          developer. My preferred tech stack is JavaScript with React, and I
          also love using HTML and CSS to create responsive web apps.
        </p>
        <p>I also tutor in computer science and work as a piano accompanist.</p>
