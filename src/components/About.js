          My name is Jack Humphrey and I am a software developer based in
          Wellington, New Zealand. I have a particular interest in front end web
          development, with a focus on usability and simplicity of design.

        <p>
          Outside of development, my interests include painting and
          illustration. I am a keen pianist and hold a DipABRSM in piano
          performance. I also enjoy creating my own music. My bachelors degree
          was in Mathematics, which has helped inform my foray into development.
        </p>

          I hold a Masters degree in Software Development from the Wellington
          ICT Graduate School, where I received a broad foundation in
          development, as well as acquiring communication skills as a developer.
          Since then, I have been working on various projects, including client
          work, and widening my skills as a developer. My preferred tech stack
          uses JavaScript with React.

          I also tutor in computer science, and work as a piano accompanist.
