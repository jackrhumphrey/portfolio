          My name is Jack Humphrey and I am a software developer based in
          Wellington, New Zealand. I have a particular interest in front end web
          development, with a focus on usability and simplicity of design.

          Outside of development, my interests include painting and
          illustration. I am a keen pianist and hold a DipABRSM in piano
          performance. I also enjoy creating my own music. My bachelors degree
          was in Mathematics.

          I hold a Masters degree in Software Development from the Wellington
          ICT Graduate School, where I learned development, as well as
          communication skills as a developer. Since then, I have been working
          on various projects, including client work. My preferred tech stack
          uses React.

          I also tutor in computer science, and work as a piano accompanist.
